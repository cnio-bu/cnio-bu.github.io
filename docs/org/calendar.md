# Outlook Calendar

CNIO provides access to Microsoft 365 and its suite of productivity tools. The Bioinformatics Unit calendar centralises all events that are relevant to the whole Unit.

!!! Warning

    The Bioinformatics Unit group calendar may not be visible for you by default. Make sure you enable it in Outlook by selecting it in your list of calendars.

## Creating Events

The idea is for the person responsible for an event to add it to the calendar, inviting those directly involved. The rest of the Unit members will then be aware of what's going on by having the events visible on their calendars.

In short:

- Events of general interest to the Unit (lab meetings, project meetings, conferences, etc.) should be created in the Bioinformatics Unit group calendar.
- The person responsible for a meeting should be the one creating the calendar event.
- People directly involved should be invited to the event.
- The "Teams" meeting option should be enabled to allow for remote participation (unless otherwise agreed).

## Synchronisation with 3rd Party Clients

Group calendars are not exposed by the Exchange protocol, and therefore can't be synced with 3rd party clients.

A workaround for this is to click on the event and select "Add to my calendar". This should copy the event to your personal calendar and keep it in sync (YMMV, as this is a Microsoft).
