# Matrix Chat

We use Matrix Chat for internal communications within the Bioinformatics Unit.

Matrix is a federated chat protocol that allows secure, decentralized communication. Users can create accounts on one server and join channels from any server on the federation.

## Creating an Account

To create an account, choose one of the available Matrix clients. The web-based version of [Element](https://app.element.io/) is a good place to start. **Choose the public matrix.org server when creating your account.** After creating your account, feel free to install the Android or iOS versions, or explore [other clients](https://matrix.org/clients/).

!!! Warning

    Make sure to create a backup of your encryption keys and keep the associated recovery key safe. Otherwise, you won't be able to access old messages after logging in again.
    You can also create your backup and recovery key in the "Security and Privacy" section of the menu that pops up by clicking on your avatar.

## Spaces and Channels

Spaces in Matrix are basically (nested) groups of subspaces, channels, and users. We have a space for the Bioinformatics Unit that groups our users and channels. Please contact `@tdido:matrix.org` to gain access to the Unit's space.
